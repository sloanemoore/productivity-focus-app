## Productivity Focus App

The productivity focus app puts everything you need to get things done right at your fingertips.

In the main section of the productivity focus app, you can view the local date and time and customize the greeting with your name. This greeting will change depending on the time of day. You can also set a main focus goal for the day.

In the weather section, you can set your location at the top right by clicking on “Set weather.” After setting your location, your local weather will display. I used the <a href="https://openweathermap.org/api">Open Weather API</a> to retrieve weather data.

In the bottom right corner, there is a todo list where you can add new tasks. When you check an item off your todo list, there’s a small celebration!

At the bottom left, you can view the image credit for the current image being displayed in the background. I used the <a href="https://unsplash.com/developers">Unsplash API</a> to retrieve attractive landscape images. If you click on the “gear” icon in this section, a popup appears where you can change the image.

Finally if you click on the About the Developer section, you can get quick access to <a href="https://nowcodethis.com/">my website</a> and my social media profiles. Reach out and let me know what you think–I’d love to hear from you!
